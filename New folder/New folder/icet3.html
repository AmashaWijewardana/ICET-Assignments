    <h1>Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h1>
    <p>Neuropiasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences, learning, and injury. This remarkable property allows the brain to form new neural connections throughout life, enabling recovery from trauma and adaptation to new environments</p>
